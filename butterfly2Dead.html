    <h1>Watch the Butterfly and Enjoy It's Beauty Without Capture</h1>
    <p>Lily watches the magestic butterfly for some time, feeling as if she has come to a point in her journey that has purpose. As the butterfly flutters about, drifting deeper into the woods, she begins to feel a heavy sleep come over her.</p>
    <p>She began to feel uneasy and as if she couldnt remember why she was there in the first place. Lily falls asleep in the Enchanted Woods.</p>
