    <h1>Take a Seat and Reflect on the Moment with the Butterfly</h1>
    <p><h3>Reflection and Pondering</h3></p>    
    <p>Lily sits on an old mossy stump for a short while thinking about her attempts to catch the butterfly. Her mind starts racing with thoughts of the capture. </p>
    <p>Something about this butterfly has changed Lily from the inside out, and she is beginning to believe she may be under a spell.</p>

    <p>The tree woman speaks to Lily and explains that the magical butterfly has sprinkled enchanted dust on her nose. She has 30 seconds before she turns into the same.</p>
    <p>Lily turns into a tree and is suspended in time. She can never leave the forest.</p>
